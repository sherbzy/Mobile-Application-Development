# Mobile-Application-Development
This repository contains the projects from the Mobile Application Development course at Colorado School of Mines taken in Spring 2022. The files for each mobile app were very large so I did not keep many assignments from this course or their instructions. The Labs folder contains screen recorded videos that show the functionality of each completed lab. The Assignments folder contains the code from three of the more complex assignments that we completed during the course.

Note: Along with the projects found here, I worked with two other peers on a semester-long application that my teammates did not wish to make public on github.

Course Overview
This course covers basic and advanced topics in mobile application development. Topics include the mobile application lifecycle, user interface components and layouts, storing persistent data, accessing network resources, using location and sensor APIs including GPS and accelerometer, starting and stopping system services, and threading. This is a project-based course where students will design and develop complete applications.
